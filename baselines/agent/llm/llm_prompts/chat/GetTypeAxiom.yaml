  Task: You are presented with a question that answering it requires commonsense reasoning ability about types of objects. By types, we mean the classes to which the objects belong to, such as "humans, animals, art works, etc.". Please take the following steps:
  1- Consider the question about the objects and the First-order logic query that is written about them. Provide a general rule about the types of objects that make the answer to the question "yes". Try to state the types that contain both necessary and sufficient conditions to make the answer "yes".
  2- Write this rule in the form of a First-order logic statement that its variables are conditioned based on their types. In other words, the acceptable format is: " predicate(x, y) | x: type of x, y: type of y"
